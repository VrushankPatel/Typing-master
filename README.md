This project is created to increase the typing speed of user. <br><br>

In this project I have programmed the different practice for different keys and for different purposes like numeric typing speed [0-9] , words practice[all characters], key board practice [A-Z] etc.

The user has to enter his/her name to enter the practice menu.<br>

In here the key-board practice contains 7 different sub-practices which train the user by giving him/her some exercises practices to do.<br>

The program is made with typing accuracy counting. if user make any kind of mistake then error will be incremented by 1.<br>
If the user complete any practice then at end of practice the new dialogue box will displayed to ask if you want to do this practice again or not. the user have to give answer in Y means yes or N means no.If user do the practice again then record will incremented by 1.<br>

The typing master program also contain the practice named word practice.<br>
This practice is programmed because if user complete all the key-board practices then he/she can test their typing speed by doing words practice.
In here 32 different words are programmed .the user can test the typing speed by note the time taken by him/her to complete the words practice.<br>

You will need the turbo C++ to compile and run this code.<br>
Here are some other screenshots of this program execution.<br>
